      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
      current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got

      “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
      looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
      experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
      incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
      best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
      I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
      startup. ”
